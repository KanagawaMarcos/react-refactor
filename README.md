# React Table

## Setting Up

From the project folder, run:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

If you do not have `yarn`, we encourage you to install it:

```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the client application.

## Overview

We'd like for you to create a **reusable** table component and replace the unordered list in `App.tsx` with the new table. Because we are not expecting you to handle styling, `Table.tsx` includes various imports that you may want to use. These components are for UI only and do not have functionality.

Your table should (in order of importance):
- have pagination
- be able to filter
- have sorting

Note: It is not expected that you complete all three functions by the end of the exercise.

## Guidelines

- At work, you have the ability to use the entire internet to solve problems. You may use whatever you need during this exercise to aid your work.
- Focus on the functionality of your table, not styling.
