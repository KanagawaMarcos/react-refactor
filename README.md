# React Table

## Setting Up

From the project folder, run:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the client application.

## Overview

We'd like for you to create a reusable table component and replace the unordered list in `App.tsx` with the new table. While styling is not necessary to complete this question, make sure that at least your application has enough functionality and UX so that it's clear what it's doing.

Your table should (in order of importance):
- have pagination as an option
- be able to filter
- have sorting by clicking on the header
